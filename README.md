# AQI Prediction & Alerts

## Overview
AQI Prediction & Alerts is a GUI-based application designed to predict Air Quality Index (AQI) based on various pollutant concentrations. It provides users with real-time predictions and categorizes the AQI level to indicate air quality conditions. Additionally, the system includes an email alert feature to notify users about hazardous air quality.

## Features
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Interactive graphical interface to input pollutant data.
- **AQI Prediction**: Machine Learning model predicts AQI based on given pollutant concentrations.
- **Categorization**: Displays the AQI category (Good, Moderate, Poor, etc.).
- **Email Alerts**: Sends notifications via email when AQI reaches dangerous levels.
- **Data Visualization**: Power BI dashboard for insights and trend analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Tkinter**: GUI development.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning model for AQI prediction.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data preprocessing.
- **SMTP (Flask Mail)**: Email alerts.
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and reporting.

## Usage
1. Enter the pollutant concentrations in the GUI.
2. Click **Predict AQI** to generate the AQI value.
3. If the AQI is hazardous, click **Send AQI Alerts** to notify via email.
4. Use Power BI for deeper insights into air quality trends.


## Future Improvements
- Integrate real-time AQI data from APIs.
- Enhance the machine learning model with deep learning techniques.
- Deploy the application as a web service.
